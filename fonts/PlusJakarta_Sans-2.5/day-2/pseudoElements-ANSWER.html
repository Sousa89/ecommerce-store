        <p>Good evening, I'm <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/13WVgB4UR7hK/giphy.gif" target="_blank">Doctor Emmet Brown</a>, I'm standing here on the parking lot of- I can't believe you loaned me a car, without telling me it had a blindspot. I could've been killed. Cause, George, she wants to go to the dance with you, she just doesn't know it yet. That's why we got to show her that <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/mvH93rThQkSe4/giphy.gif" target="_blank">you, George McFly, are a fighter</a>. You're somebody who's gonna stand up for yourself, someone who's gonna protect her. Lynda, first of all, I'm not your answering service. Second of all, somebody named Greg or Craig called you just a little while ago. <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/13WVgB4UR7hK/giphy.gif" target="_blank">Hello</a>.</p> <p>You got a real attitude problem, McFly. <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/mvH93rThQkSe4/giphy.gif" target="_blank">You're a slacker</a>. You remind me of you father when he went her, he was a slacker too. I'm telling the truth, Doc, you gotta believe me. Hey Marty, I'm not your answering service, but you're outside pouting about the car, Jennifer Parker called you twice. Don't say a word.</p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you telling me that it's 8:25? Oh honey, he's teasing you, nobody has two television sets.</p>
				</blockquote>

				<p>If you believe in progress, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas, progress is his middle name. Mayor Red Thomas's progress platform means more jobs, better education, bigger civic improvements, and lower taxes. On election day, cast your vote for <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/mvH93rThQkSe4/giphy.gif" target="_blank">a proven leader</a>, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas... You do? Whoa, whoa, kid, kid, stop, stop, stop, stop. Just finishing up the second coat now. I still don't understand, how am I supposed to go to the dance with her, if she's already going to the dance with you.</p> <p>My oh my <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/13WVgB4UR7hK/giphy.gif" target="_blank">Doc, you disintegrated Einstein</a>. That Biff, what a character. Always trying to get away with something. Been on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him-. Jennifer, oh are you a sight for sore eyes. <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/mvH93rThQkSe4/giphy.gif" target="_blank">Listen, Doc. Let's go.</a> Let me look at you. Radiation suit, of course, cause all of the fall out from the atomic wars. This is truly amazing, a portable television studio.</p>
